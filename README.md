# ML From Scratch

Machine learning fundamentals implemented **from scratch** to build deep, engineering-level understanding of how models actually work.

This repository avoids high-level libraries (e.g., scikit-learn) and focuses on:
- First principles
- Mathematical intuition
- Explicit training loops
- Clear decision-making logic

---

## Why This Repository Exists

Modern ML engineers are expected to **understand systems**, not just call APIs.

This repository was created to:
- Eliminate gaps in ML fundamentals
- Build confidence in model mechanics
- Treat ML as a sequence of decisions, not magic

Every model here is implemented step by step using **NumPy and pure Python**.

---

## Learning Philosophy

- **Depth over speed**
- **Build > consume**
- **One clean output at a time**
- **Same ML foundations across multiple domains**

---

## Domains of Application

The same core ML concepts are applied and explained across:

- Finance & Accounting
- Business Decision Systems
- Human Health
- Animal Feed & Animal Health
- Engineering & Operations
